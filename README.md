This project revolves around creating a career recommendation platform for users. We began by working with data from the O*NET SOC database; the various csv files within this repository were collected from the database and further wrangled within the project.ipynb file. In order to work with this project, the website folder is only necessary. Dowloading this folder and running the app.py file within terminal will create a Flask server link to interact with our project.
